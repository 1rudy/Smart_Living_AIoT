## STORY
Smart Living [AIoT] is an IoT-based project to control home appliances through voice commands. IoT or the Internet of Things, is an upcoming technology that 
allows us to control hardware devices through the Internet. Here we propose to use IoT to control home appliances, thus automating modern homes through the
Internet using voice commands. Our user-friendly interface allows users to easily control lights, fans, TV, fridge, and AC pump. The home security system has
become vital for every house. It is important. Here we propose to use AI and IoT to assist users in improving the door security of sensitive locations by using face
detection and recognition.

## INTRODUCTION

Making homes even smarter is the goal of voice-based home automation systems. Voice commands and cell phones will be used to operate small appliances in the house. 
It will be easier to get by as a result. According to their needs, customers will be able to add or remove additional electronic devices using web applications.
There is a growing need for efficient and reliable communication between various smart devices within a household. These devices, such as smart lights, 
smart appliances, and sensors, need to exchange data and control commands seamlessly to create an intelligent and interconnected home environment. However, 
the challenge lies in establishing a robust communication protocol that is lightweight, low-power, and can handle a multitude of devices without causing network 
congestion. As a solution, adopting the MQTT protocol in home automation enables devices to easily publish and subscribe to specific topics, allowing them to share 
real-time data and execute control commands effectively. MQTT's efficiency, simplicity, and support for various IoT platforms make it an essential and indispensable
component in home automation systems, promoting a seamless and smarter living experience for homeowners.
